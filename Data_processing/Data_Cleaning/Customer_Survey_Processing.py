#In the data processing script, I started by loading the customer survey dataset and performing an initial data quality checkâ€”inspecting column names, checking for missing values, and detecting duplicates.
#To ensure consistency, I standardized categorical data (eg. converting text to lowercase and stripping spaces).
# Numerical columns such as Recommendation Score and Customer Reviews were formatted to appropriate data types, with only Customer Reviews being normalized using StandardScaler. Outlier visualization was conducted using a boxplot to understand data distribution.
# Finally, after verifying all transformations, the cleaned dataset was saved for further feature engineering.
